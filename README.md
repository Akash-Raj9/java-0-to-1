# Welcome to Java 0 to 1

Welcome to **Java 0 to 1**! These sessions are designed to transform you into a proficient problem solver and a skilled Java programmer. Throughout these sessions, we will focus on developing your problem-solving abilities and then dive deep into the world of Java programming.

The name **0 to 1** signifies our commitment to taking you from no prior coding knowledge (0) to becoming a confident and capable Java developer (1). Whether you come from a non-technical background or have no prior coding experience, these sessions are tailored for you.

Get ready to embark on this exciting journey and become a confident Java developer! I will also be sharing my experiences, including the dos and don'ts, to help guide you along the way.
