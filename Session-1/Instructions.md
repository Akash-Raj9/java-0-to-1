Hello everyone,

Welcome to the Problem Solving Session. 

In this directory, you will find some problems to solve. Use your own methods to solve them and create a folder with your name. Write down your approach in a text file and add it to your folder.

More problems will be added over time, so keep an eye out.

Check out the problems for Session-1 here:

Submit your solutions in the [Solutions](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-1/Solutions) folder by creating a folder with your name, like this:
