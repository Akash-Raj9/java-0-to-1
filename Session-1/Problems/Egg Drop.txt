Egg Dropping Problem (Identical Eggs, 100 Floors)

Problem:
 
You are given k identical eggs, and you need to find the minimum 
number of drops required to determine the highest safe floor x 
in a building of 100 floors. The eggs are identical, 
meaning they behave the same way when dropped. 
If an egg breaks after a drop, it cannot be used again, 
and if it doesnâ€™t break, you can reuse it. 
The goal is to determine the critical floor, x, 
such that if an egg is dropped from floor x or higher, 
it will break, and if dropped from a floor below x, it will not.

Objective:

Determine the minimum number of drops required to identify the highest safe floor (x) in a 100-floor building. 
Explain the reasoning behind the solution. 
Additionally, identify the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking.
