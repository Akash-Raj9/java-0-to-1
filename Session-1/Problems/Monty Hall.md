# Monty Hall Problem

## Problem:

You are on a game show.
There are three doors.
Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats.
You choose a door.
The host, who knows what's behind each door, 
opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat.
The host then asks if you want to switch your choice to the other 
unopened door or stick with your original choice.

## Objective:

When do you have a higher probability of winning the car: 
if you switch your choice or if you stick with your original choice?
and why?
