As initial probability of getting car is 1/3 , and goat is 2/3. But after host reveal one door to reveal goat. after that probability of car is 1/2 ,and goat is also 1/2.(i.e.,same probability).so i will stay with the chosen door as the probability of getting anything is now same and now there is no sense of changing the door.
