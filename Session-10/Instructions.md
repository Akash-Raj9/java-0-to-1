Hello everyone,

Welcome to **Session 10**.

For today's session, we will be covering **Conditionals in Java**. This includes learning how to use **if-else** and **switch** statements to control the flow of your program based on different conditions.

Please read the session notes in the following links:

- [Conditionals Overview](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-10/Conditionals.md)
- [If-Else Conditionals](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-10/If-Else-Conditionals.md)
- [Switch Statements](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-10/Switch-Conditionals.md)
- [Difference Between If-Else and Switch](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-10/Difference.md)

**Important:** Please go through the **Problems** folder in [Problems Directory](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-10/Problems).  
Solve the problems and write your answers in the individual folders within the [Solutions Folder](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-10/Solutions).

Here are some key areas you will be working on:

- Understanding the syntax and use cases of **if-else** statements.
- Learning how to implement **switch** statements for handling multiple conditions.
- Identifying when to use **if-else** vs **switch** for better code readability and efficiency.

**Important:**  
Remember, **create a pull request** for your work before the next session.

If you haven't read the previous session notes, please do so.
