###  When to Use Which Conditional?

- **Use `if-else` when:**
  - You need to compare ranges or evaluate complex expressions.
  - You need to check for different conditions that don't revolve around a single variable.
- **Use `switch` when:**
  - You are comparing a single variable to multiple fixed values (like days of the week, menu options, etc.).
  - You want cleaner, more readable code when dealing with multiple possible values.
