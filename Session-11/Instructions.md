Hello everyone,

Welcome to **Session 11**.

For today's session, we will be covering **Loops in Java**. This includes learning how to use **for**, **while**, and **do-while** loops to execute a block of code multiple times based on different conditions.

Please read the session notes in the following links:

- [Loops Overview](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-11/Loops.md)
- [For Loop](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-11/ForLoop.md)
- [While Loop](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-11/WhileLoop.md)
- [Do-While Loop](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-11/DoWhileLoop.md)

**Important:** Please go through the **Problems** folder in [Problems Directory](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-11/Problems).  
Solve the problems and write your answers in the individual folders within the [Solutions Folder](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-11/Solutions).

Here are some key areas you will be working on:

- Understanding the syntax and use cases of **for** loops.
- Learning how to implement **while** and **do-while** loops for handling repetitive tasks.
- Identifying when to use different types of loops for better code readability and efficiency.

**Important:**  
Remember, **create a pull request** for your work before the next session.

If you haven't read the previous session notes, please do so.
