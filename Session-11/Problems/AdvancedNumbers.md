## Problem 9: Advanced Number Comparison
Create a Java program that compares five integer numbers and prints the largest and smallest ones using nested `if-else` statements.

**Requirements**:
- Use nested `if-else` statements to compare the numbers.
- Handle cases where some or all numbers are equal gracefully.
- Output the largest and smallest numbers or indicate if all numbers are equal.

**Example**:
- Input: `5, 7, 3, 9, 1`
- Output: `The largest number is 9` and `The smallest number is 1`

- Input: `4, 4, 4, 4, 4`
- Output: `All numbers are equal`
