## Problem 7: Mixed Loop Data Processing
Create a Java program that processes a list of student scores using a combination of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops:
- Use a `do-while` loop to ensure at least 10 scores are entered.
- Use a `for` loop to calculate the average score.
- Use a `while` loop to count the number of scores above the average.

**Constraints**:
- Ensure the program handles invalid input gracefully.
- The program should output the average score and the count of scores above the average.
