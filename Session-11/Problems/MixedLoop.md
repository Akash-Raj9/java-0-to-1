## Problem 5: Mixed Loop Challenge
Create a Java program that combines `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops to solve the following problem:
- Prompt the user to enter a series of numbers (at least 5 numbers).
- Use a `do-while` loop to ensure at least 5 numbers are entered.
- Use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of the entered numbers.
- Use a `while` loop to find the maximum number in the series.


**Constraints**:
- Ensure the program handles invalid input gracefully.
- The program should output the sum and the maximum number.
