## Problem 2: Prime Number Checker
Write a Java program that uses a `while` loop to check if a given number is prime. The program should prompt the user to enter a number and then determine if it is a prime number.
**Constraints**:
- Use a `while` loop to iterate through possible divisors.
- Optimize the loop to run up to the square root of the number.
