## Problem 6: Simple Interest Calculation
Write a Java program to calculate the simple interest given the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period. The formula to calculate simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{100} \]

**Constraints**:

- The principal amount, rate of interest, and time period should be provided as input by the user.
- Ensure the inputs are positive numbers.
- Display the calculated simple interest.
