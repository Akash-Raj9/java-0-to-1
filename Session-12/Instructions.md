Hello everyone,

Welcome to **Session 12**.

For today's session, we will be covering **Methods in Java**. This includes learning how to define and call methods, understanding method parameters, return types, and method overloading.

Please read the session notes in the following links:

- [Methods Overview](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-12/Methods.md)
- [Scopes](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-12/Scopes.md)
- [Shadowing](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-12/Shadowing.md)
- [Variable Arguments](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-12/VariableArguments.md)

**Important:** Please go through the **Problems** folder in [Problems Directory](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-12/Problems).  
Solve the problems and write your answers in the individual folders within the [Solutions Folder](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-12/Solutions).

Here are some key areas you will be working on:

- Understanding the syntax and use cases of methods.
- Learning how to implement methods for modular and reusable code.
- Identifying when to use different types of method parameters and return types.

**Important:**  
Remember, **create a pull request** for your work before the next session.

If you haven't read the previous session notes, please do so.
