## Problem 3: Decimal to Binary Conversion

Write a method to convert a given decimal number to its binary representation using loops and conditionals.

### Explanation

Binary representation of a number is its expression in the base-2 numeral system. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented as 1010 in binary. This can be achieved by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainders.

### Constraints

- The method should not use any built-in functions for conversion.
- The method should handle negative decimal numbers as well.

### Example

```java
decimalToBinary(10); // returns "1010"
decimalToBinary(-10); // returns "-1010"
```
