## Problem 4: LCM Calculation

Write a method to compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers using loops and conditionals.

### Explanation

The Least Common Multiple of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. For example, the LCM of 4 and 5 is 20. This can be found by iterating through multiples of the larger number until a multiple of the smaller number is found.

### Constraints

- The method should not use any built-in functions for GCD or LCM.
- The method should handle large values of the input numbers efficiently.

### Example

```java
lcm(4, 5); // returns 20
```
