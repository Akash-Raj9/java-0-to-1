## Problem 8: Perfect Number Check

Write a method to check if a given number is a perfect number using loops and conditionals.

### Explanation

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

### Constraints

- The method should not use any built-in functions for checking perfect numbers.
- The method should handle large values of the input number efficiently.

### Example

```java
isPerfectNumber(6); // returns true
isPerfectNumber(10); // returns false
```
