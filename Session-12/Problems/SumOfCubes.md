## Problem 9: Sum of Cubes

Write a method to compute the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers using loops and conditionals.

### Explanation

The sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers is the result of adding the cubes of all numbers from 1 to n. For example, the sum of the cubes of the first 3 natural numbers (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3) is 36.

### Constraints

- The method should not use any formula for the sum of cubes.
- The method should handle large values of n efficiently.

### Example

```java
sumOfCubes(3); // returns 36
```
