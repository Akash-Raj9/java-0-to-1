## Problem 6: Sum of Squares

Write a method to compute the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers using loops and conditionals.

### Explanation

The sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers is the result of adding the squares of all numbers from 1 to n. For example, the sum of the squares of the first 3 natural numbers (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) is 14.

### Constraints

- The method should not use any formula for the sum of squares.
- The method should handle large values of n efficiently.

### Example

```java
sumOfSquares(3); // returns 14
```
