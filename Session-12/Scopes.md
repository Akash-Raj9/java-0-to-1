### Scope in Java

Scope refers to the visibility and lifetime of variables. There are different types of scope in Java:

- **Block Scope**: Variables declared inside a block `{}` are only accessible within that block.
- **Method Scope**: Variables declared within a method are only accessible within that method.
- **Class Scope**: Variables declared within a class but outside any method are accessible by all methods of the class.
