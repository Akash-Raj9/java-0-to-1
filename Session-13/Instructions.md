Hello everyone,

Welcome to **Session 13**.

For today's session, we will be covering **Strings in Java**. This includes learning about interfaces, string handling, and serialization.

Please read the session notes in the following links:

- [Strings in Java Part - 1](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-13/Strings.md)
- [Interfaces](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-13/Interfaces.md)
- [Literal and New](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-13/LiteralAndNew.md)
- [Serializable](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-13/Serializable.md)
- [String Constant Pool](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-13/StringConstantPool.md)

Here are some key areas you will be working on:

- Understanding the use and implementation of interfaces.
- Learning about string handling and memory management.
- Exploring serialization and its use cases.
