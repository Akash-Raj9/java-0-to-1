# Git Concepts - Git History Management

In this guide, we cover some important Git concepts. Each section explains one of the core Git techniques and provides links to detailed explanations and usage examples.

### 1. [Git Rebase](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-7/Rebase.md)
Rebase allows you to rewrite the commit history by applying your changes on top of another branch's commits. It helps to keep your commit history cleaner and linear.

- Learn how to use **git rebase**.
- Understand when to use rebase instead of merge.
- Explore how to handle conflicts during a rebase.

### 2. [Git Reset](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-7/Reset.md)
Reset lets you undo changes in your working directory and Git history. It has three main modes: **soft**, **mixed**, and **hard** reset, which can be used for different purposes.

- Explore how to **undo commits**, **unstage changes**, and **discard changes** completely.
- Learn the difference between each type of reset and when to use them.

### 3. [Git Stash](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-7/Stash.md)
Git stash allows you to temporarily save your changes and come back to them later without committing. It’s useful when you need to switch branches but don't want to commit unfinished work.

- Understand how to **stash** and **apply** changes.
- Learn how to list and manage stashes.
- Use stashing to improve your workflow when switching contexts or tasks.

### 4. [Git Squash](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-7/Squash.md)
Squashing is the process of combining multiple commits into a single one. This helps clean up your commit history, especially when you have small or related commits that don’t add significant value on their own.

- Learn how to **squash commits** using interactive rebase.
- Discover when to squash commits before merging to maintain a clean commit history.
