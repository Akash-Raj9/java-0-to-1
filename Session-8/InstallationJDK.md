## Installing Java (JDK)

To start coding in Java, you'll need to install the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website:

[Download JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)

Alternatively, if you're using Linux, you can install the JDK via the terminal with the following command:

For **Ubuntu**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
```

For **Fedora**:
```bash
sudo dnf install java-17-openjdk-devel
```

Once installed, check if Java is installed correctly by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
java --version
```

This should display the installed version of Java.
