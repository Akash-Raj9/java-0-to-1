Hello everyone,

Welcome to **Session 9**.

For today's session, we will be diving deeper into **Java Architecture**. We will explore how Java works under the hood and how the Java Development Kit (JDK), Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interact with each other. Understanding the architecture will help you grasp how Java code gets compiled and executed, making it easier to troubleshoot and optimize your programs.

Please read the session notes in the following link:

Make sure to practice the concepts from the earlier sessions:

- [Session 1](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-1/Instructions.md)
- [Session 2](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-2/Instructions.md)
- [Session 3](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-3/Instructions.md)
- [Session 4](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-4/Instructions.md)
- [Session 5](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-5/Instructions.md)
- [Session 6](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-6/Instructions.md)
- [Session 7](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-7/Instructions.md)
- [Session 8](https://github.com/rothardo/java-0-to-1/blob/master/Session-8/Instructions.md)

**Today's focus:**
- Explore the architecture of Java (JDK, JRE, JVM)
- Learn how Java code is compiled and executed
- Understand the relationship between compile-time and runtime
- Visualize the flow of Java code through the system
